    "# Lab 1 (b)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "In this lab, we'll explore how to host a large language model on Amazon SageMaker using  [Hugging Face LLM Inference Container for Amazon SageMaker](https://huggingface.co/blog/sagemaker-huggingface-llm), which allows you to easily deploy the most popular open-source LLMs, including Falcon, StarCoder, BLOOM, GPT-NeoX, Llama, and T5\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Language models have recently exploded in both size and popularity. In 2018, BERT-large entered the scene and, with its 340M parameters and novel transformer architecture, set the standard on NLP task accuracy. Within just a few years, state-of-the-art NLP model size has grown by more than 500x with models such as OpenAI’s 175 billion parameter GPT-3 and similarly sized open source Bloom 176B raising the bar on NLP accuracy. This increase in the number of parameters is driven by the simple and empirically-demonstrated positive relationship between model size and accuracy: more is better. With easy access from models zoos such as HuggingFace and improved accuracy in NLP tasks such as classification and text generation, practitioners are increasingly reaching for these large models. However, deploying them can be a challenge because of their size.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Background and Details\n",
    "We'll be working with [Falcon-40B-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-40b-instruct) that was developed by the  Technology Innovation Institute (TII). Falcon-40B-Instruct is a 40B parameters causal decoder-only model built by TII based on Falcon-40B and finetuned on a mixture of Baize. It is made available under the Apache 2.0 license.\n",

    "- Mitigating bias: LLMs have been shown to produce biased outputs when prompted with certain topics or language patterns. By engineering prompts that avoid biased language and encourage fairness, developers can help mitigate these issues.\n",
